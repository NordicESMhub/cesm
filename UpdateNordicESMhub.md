# How to use NordicESMHub cime repository

## Running CLM/CTSM 

Read [CTSM@UiO documentation](https://ctsm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Running CESM 

For any other configuration, make sure you use a noresm release (it is not related to [NorESM](https://noresm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) but contains machines and configuration files for running on a Nordic HPC machine.

For now, we support Norwegian Sigma-2 HPCs. Feel free to add new platforms. If you have any doubts or need help, join us on [zulip](https://nordicesmhub.zulipchat.com/).
